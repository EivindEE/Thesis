\section{Motivation}
At the moment, adding semantic markup to websites is unfeasible for most content creators on the web.
Adding proper meta data does not only mean that you need to know HTML, 
but also that you need to understand the concept of ontologies and set theory. 
In addition you need to know of the implementation of RDFa, microdata or microformats, 
as well as the content of the specific ontologies you intent to use on your site.


It is estimated that the amount of information created by humans before 2005, 
is smaller that the amount of information created after 2005.

I chose to develop using node.js because it's a new and exciting technology which would make it posible to write the entire app using one programming language for front end, server side and as the database query language.

Creating a web app allows me to work with both back end server side components, and front end work.
