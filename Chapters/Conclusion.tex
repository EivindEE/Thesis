\section{Findings}

We have found that using siblings of synsets as a basis for mapping to ontologies is to na√Øve.
Our study has found no reason to believe that siblings reliably tell us anything about the semantic properties of a synset.

Using hypernyms as a basis for mapping gives correct mappings.
The approach does however result inn high level mappings, and could benefit from further refinement.

We found that WordNet was unable to capture the gramatical number of natural language.
This means that the tool won't have any way to distinguish between ontological types which differ in this respect.

The metadata we created using \theartefact\ was comparable to that pressent at current websites which use schema.org to
enrich their content.

We found that we could add metadata to the webpages without changing the way they were displayed in the browser.
